        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Izelle Pama — a first-year Computer Engineering student with a deep passion for technology and innovation. I'm driven by the desire to create meaningful projects that make a difference through the power of code.

       As I begin my journey in this field, I’m eager to learn new programming languages, build real-world applications, and challenge myself through creative problem-solving. I believe that even the simplest line of code can spark something powerful.

      My goal is to develop tools, games, and systems that can help others and improve lives. I'm especially interested in exploring web development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence as I grow in my career.

               Using C++, we developed a game called "Keyboard Warrior" — a fast-paced speed typing game built during the 1st semester of our PLD subject at NCST. It's not just about typing quickly, but also thinking fast under pressure as you respond to in-game prompts that challenge your logic and reflexes.

               Worked with a group to develop a fully functional E-commerce website, applying basic front-end and back-end concepts and presenting it during the NCST exhibit. The website was designed to simulate a real online shopping. It featured user registration, product listings, a shopping cart, and a simple checkout process — giving us hands-on experience with web development and teamwork in a real-world scenario.
