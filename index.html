        <p><b>Hi, I'm Izelle Pama</b>, a first-year Computer Engineering student. I'm passionate about technology and deeply inspired to create innovative and meaningful projects through the power of coding. As I begin this journey, I’m excited to learn new programming languages, build real-world applications, and challenge myself with creative problem-solving.</p>

        <p>I believe that even the simplest lines of code can make a big impact, and I hope to use my skills to develop tools, games, or systems that can help others and make life better. I'm also eager to explore fields like web development, software engineering, and AI as I grow in my career.</p>

        <p>My goal is not just to learn, but to create—to turn ideas into reality through technology and become a confident, capable engineer who can contribute to the world in a meaningful way.</p>
